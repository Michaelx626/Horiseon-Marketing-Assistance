# Title
Horiseon Marketing Assistance

## Description
The motivation of this project is to debug and make the CSS and HTML files more clean and polished. There were a lot of repetitive codes that aren't necessary. It is to develop a better quality webpage for all users while being familiar with most semantic elements to provide a more accessible search engine. By making these updates, I learned how to polish a more clean and understanding CSS and HTML file.
